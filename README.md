## 📡 The Engine
The **Global Macro Compass** automatically aggregates critical financial pulses—**Growth, Inflation, Liquidity, and Sentiment**—into a single, visually stunning dashboard. It calculates a real-time **Market Regime Score** to help identify whether the current environment is **Risk-On**, **Risk-Off**, or **Neutral**.

### Features:
- **Composite Alpha Signal**: Weighted scoring logic based on 10Y-2Y Spreads, CPI, Fed Funds Rate, and Asset Momentum.
- **Dynamic Heatmaps**: Visualization of asset correlations across S&P 500, Gold, Oil, and Global Indices.
- **Sentiment Pulse**: High-frequency news sentiment analysis powered by Alpha Vantage.
- **Standalone Dashboard**: A premium, 2026-styled UI using Tailwind CSS and ApexCharts.
